# FAQs of DSGW-093 ESP32 Gateway Hardware Development  
## Wi-Fi Capability  
### Can your DSGW-092 ESP32 gateway connect to over 20 ESP32 modules through WiFi?  
This requirement necessitates the WiFi AP mode on the gateway, which is not supported by the WiFi chip on the DSGW-092 gateway hardware. You can consider trying the [DSGW-030 MTK7688 WiFi Gateway](https://www.dusuniot.com/blog/wi-fi-gateway-recommendation/) or [DSGW-040 MT7620 WiFi Router Gateway](https://wiki.dusuniot.com/iot_gateway_with_applications/dsgw-040-mt7620-router-gateway/overview) instead.
