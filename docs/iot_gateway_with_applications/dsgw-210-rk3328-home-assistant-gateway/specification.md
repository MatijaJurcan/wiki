# **1. Product Introduction**

## **1.1. Purpose and Description**

The DSGW-210-HA, powered by Roombanker, is an advanced smart device that extends the capabilities of the DSGW-210 Edge Computer Gateway. It is a highly efficient, out-of-the-box device that allows users to run Home Assistant and experience the world's best home automation in the easiest way possible.

Integrating over 1000 different devices and services, the DSGW-210-HA enables users to build powerful automation and gain insight into their energy usage. It is a complete local alternative to solutions such as SmartThings and HomeBridge, offering an easy-to-use interface and enabling local control of smart home devices without relying on the cloud.

By keeping everything local, the DSGW-210-HA offers better security, greater reliability and more flexibility than many cloud-connected devices.

## **1.2. What is the Home Assistant**

Home Assistant is a free and open-source home automation software that acts as a central control system for smart home devices, focusing on local control and privacy. It can be accessed via a web- based user interface, companion apps for Android and iOS, or voice commands through supported virtual assistants such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa.

The software supports IoT technologies, devices, software, applications, and services through modular integration components. These components include native integrations for local connectivity protocols such as Zigbee and Z-Wave and support for controlling proprietary ecosystems if they provide access through a public API for third-party interfaces.

Once installed as a computing device, the Home Assistant acts as a central control system for home automation, commonly referred to as an intelligent home 'hub,' 'bridge,' 'gateway,' 'controller,' or 'coordinator.’ With an emphasis on local control and privacy, Home Assistant provides users a flexible and secure way to manage their smart home devices.

## **1.3. Home Assistant Features**

**Works with over 1000+ Integrations**

Home Assistant integrates with over a thousand different devices and services. Once started, Home Assistant will automatically scan your network for known devices and allow you to easily set them up.

**Powerful Automation**

Once you have integrated all your devices at home, you can unleash Home Assistant’s advanced automation engine to make your homework for you.

- Turn on the light when the sun sets or when coming home
- Alert you when you leave your garage door open.

**Extend your System with Add-ons**

Home Assistant is not just limited to Home Assistant. Easily install other applications that will help you manage your home.

- Run AdGuard, a DNS-based ad blocker
- Run third-party automation engines like Node-Red
- Turn Home Assistant Blue into a Spotify Connect target

**All your Smart Home Data stays Local**

Home Assistant keeps your data local. No need for a cloud. Home Assistant communicates with your devices locally and will fall back to pulling in data from the cloud if there is no other option. No data is stored in the cloud, and everything is processed locally.

**Companion Mobile Apps**

Use the official Home Assistant app, a convenient companion to quickly control your devices and be notified when things happen in your home, even on your wrist, using the Apple Watch. You can control your lights, thermostat, TV, and music. Home Assistant integrates with over 1,000 different devices and services via the DSGW-210-HA. It works with popular brands like Philips Hue and that odd-ball lightbulb you picked up at a sale.

Home Assistant isn’t limited to integrating hardware devices either. Your dashboards and automation can also use services to get information about your commute, air quality in your area, or the latest currency exchange rates.

**Use Pre-Made Automation or Create Your Own**

Everything in your home becomes a data point and can be automated in the DSGW- 210-HA. The user can create powerful automation, or select one of the many automation blueprints contributed by Home Assistant’s global community of usersby using the advanced automation editor. Blueprints are templates that you can easily configure, like picking a presence sensor and an area to create presence-based automation.

The apps can also send your location home to use presence detection as part of your automation. Data is sent directly to your home without access by third parties.

**Track and Manage Energy Consumption**

The home energy management feature as the main feature of the Home Assistant Gateway enables the user to track the home energy consumption. The user can monitor both how much energy they’re using at the moment and trends over time via connecting DSGW-210-HA with a supported smart end device.

**DSGW-210-HA is Configurable and Open**

DSGW-210-HA contains a TF Card extension port. As you install more third-party applications or collect more sensor data, you can expand storage capacity by upgrading eMMC flash storage, or by using TF Card.
 DSGW-210-HA comes with the latest and greatest Zigbee radio chip, which can be compatible with the upcoming Matter smart home connectivity standard, from Silicon Labs to communicate with smart devices in your home. In addition to Zigbee, it also has an integrated Z-Wave protocol.

**Access from anywhere**

DSGW-210-HA is not just limited to local control. It also supports remote control. Using the official Home Assistant App, you can quickly access your Home Assistant instance from anywhere. At the same time, all data between your phone and your Home Assistant instance is fully encrypted.

## **1.4. The official ways to install Home Assistant**

Now the user can install the Home Assistant in four official and supported ways:

- Home Assistant OS
- Home Assistant Container
- Home Assistant Core

* Home Assistant Supervised

The DSGW-210-HA is pre-installed with the Home Assistant Supervised. All of those four installations have some pros and Cons, and the comparison of them is listed in the following table:
