# **5. Software Requirements**

This software is built on the MTK platform and runs on the OpenWrt system. It supports features such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee3.0, OTA, and MQTT.

## 5.1 Definition

### 5.1.1.   Boot Up

Upon power insertion, both the green and yellow LEDs light up. Once the yellow LED turns off and the green LED starts blinking, and then remains lit, the gateway has successfully booted up.

### 5.1.2.   Reset

Press and hold the button for 10 seconds to perform a reset function. This will erase all matched information.

### 5.1.3.   LED Indicators

Green LED: Indicates system startup.

Yellow LED: Signals operation of Zigbee. When the gateway communicates with a sensor, this LED blinks. If the gateway enters pairing mode, the LED will blink as well.

Red LED: Used to indicate connectivity with the cloud. If the gateway connects successfully, the Red LED turns off. If the connection fails, it remains lit.

### 5.1.4.   Wi-Fi Configuration

The Wi-Fi supports both AP and client modes, which can be switched as needed. The name of the AP: xxxxxxx. Password: xxxxxxx.

### 5.1.5.   Zigbee Configuration

The Zigbee stack, version 3.0, supports ZHA, GreenPower, ZLL, and more. It is compatible with most clusters of ZigBee devices, such as door sensors, leak sensors, motion sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, smart plugs, smart lamps, smoke sensors, curtains, and so on. Devices can be added via the web or command.

### 5.1.6.   BLE Configuration

The gateway supports iBeacon, Eddystone, BLE sensors, and the SIG mesh function.

![](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/202311271133139.png)

Beacons attached to the assets to be tracked emit BLE signals, which the Smart Gateway receives installed within the building. The Gateway processes this data and sends it to a server via Wi-Fi or Ethernet. The positions of the assets are then displayed on a map, and motion statistics can be retrieved.

## **6.2.  AP-02 Smart Home IoT**

![](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/20231127113439.png)

The Smart Gateway serves as the smart home’s brain, connecting wirelessly with a wide range of smart devices and enabling them to work together seamlessly.

 

Key features of the Smart Gateway include:

 

•     Control lights, electronics, and small appliances from anywhere, providing convenient remote access.

•     Schedule devices to turn on and off at different times of the day, automating routines and enhancing energy efficiency.

•     Receive alerts when there is unexpected activity in your home, ensuring you stay informed and aware of any potential security concerns.

•     Set connected lights to turn on and off based on people's presence, creating a more responsive and intuitive lighting experience.

•     Monitor moisture and temperature levels, allowing you to keep track of environmental conditions within your home.

 

With its versatile functionality, the Smart Gateway empowers you to manage your smart home effortlessly and enjoy a more connected and comfortable living environment.

##  **6.3.  AP-03 Smart Healthcare**

![](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/20231127113552.png)

Health and medical equipment can be connected to the cloud platform through the gateway, enabling the remote transmission of health and medical data. This allows doctors to provide medication guidance to patients with chronic diseases remotely.

Additionally, the gateway is equipped with Bluetooth roaming functionality. In large areas, the device can seamlessly switch its connection from gateway A to gateway B through Bluetooth roaming.
