# 1.Introduction
This Quick Start Guide explains the basics: how to connect and set up your target on the network; how to install the SDK; how to build the firmware images，and how to use gateway。
The Linux Software Developer’s Kit (SDK) is an embedded hardware and software suite that enables Linux developers to create applications on Dusun’s DSGK-061 gateway.
Base on the 4.19.232 Linux kernel, and leveraging existing open source software, the SDK simplifies the process of adding custom applications. Device drivers, GNU toolchain, Pre-defined configuration profiles, and sample applications are all in included.

# 3.Target Setup

This section describes how to connect the gateway into your host computer and network. 
- Connecting a gateway - Power 
1. Make sure that the power adapter is 12V/2A. 
2. Select the appropriate power plug adaptor for your geographical location. Insert it into the slot on the Universal Power Supply; then plug the power supply into an outlet. 
3. Connect the output plug of the power supply to the gateway
- Connecting a gateway – ADB
1.Connect one end of the  usb cable to the usb port on the laptop or desktop
2.Connect the other end of usb cable to the debug port on the gateway. 
3.adb shell login gateway .

# 4.Compile the Environment to Build

Please use ubuntu 18.04 .iso image to setup your build environment. You can use a virtual machine or a physical PC to install ubuntu 18.04.

## 4.1Virtual Machine
It is recommended that novice users use virtual machines, install ubuntu 18.04 to the virtual machine, and leave enough disk space (at least 100G) for the virtual machine. 

## 4.2Ubuntu PC Compile the Environment to Build
The use of physical machine compilation users can use a ubuntu PC.

# 5.SDK Acquisition and Preparation

## 5.1Download the source code from the Dusun FTP

The source package name will be rk356x_linux-*.tar.gz, get it from Dusun FTP.
- Google driver URL：
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jx_tjzgsouQT8lE8_OgguQDlGUt95Qqq?usp=drive_link

## 5.2Code Compression Package Check
The next step can be taken only after generating the MD5 value of the source compression package and comparing the MD5 value of the MD5 .txt text to confirm that the MD5 value is the same, and if the MD5 value is not the same, the energy code pack is damaged, please download it again.

```
$ md5sum rk3568J_android12_rockchip*.tar.gz
```

## 5.3 The Source Compression Package is Unzipped

Copy the source code to the corresponding directory and unzip the source code compression package.

## 5.4 Image Downloads

- Get Image Url：
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TltWhG_QSg4emOgspspTGvJZZ4Ce1AJD?usp=drive_link


# 6. Code Compilation

## 6.1 Start Compiling

Build a complete directory of firmware files:rockdev/Image-rk3568_s/*.img , update.img includes all firmware for full upgrade.
```
$ source build/envsetup.sh
$ lunch 
$ ./build.sh  -UKAu
```
The build will take a long time, please wait patiently. 
After update.img is built, burn it to the board according to chapter 7.


## 6.2 Compiled Each Image Part Separately
### 6.2.1 The build system and the image structure
The upate.img is composed of several parts. Main parts are uboot.img, boot.img, recovery.img, rootfs.img.
uboot.img contains bootloader uboot
boot.img contains the device tree .dtb image, Linux kernel image
super.img: The android rootfs image. In normal mode, system boot and mount this rootfs image.
You may need to build the images separately, especially when you focus on single module (e.g. uboot or kernel driver) development. Then you can build only that part of image and update that partition in flash.

### 6.2.2 Build Uboot only
```
$ ./build.sh -U
```
### 6.2.3 Build Linux Kernel Only
```
$ ./build.sh -K
```
### 6.2.4 Build System Only
```
$ ./build.sh -A
```
### 6.2.6 Final Image Packaging
```
$ ./build.sh -u
```
This command making rockdev/Image-rk3568_s/*.img scatter firmware packaging builds in the directory update.img

# 7. Hardware interface development 
## 7.1 RS232
View serial port information  by /dev/ttyS9
```
#cat /dev/ttyS9
```
## 7.2 LAN/WAN
The gateway has two network ports:eth0 and eth1. Both network ports can switch between LAN and WAN

```
#ifconfig

# 8. VNC Use 

The main purpose of using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) on Android devices is to achieve remote desktop control. VNC allows you to control another device or computer (server) on one device (client). For Android devices, you can either set it as a VNC server (for other devices to remotely control it) or as a VNC client (for controlling other VNC servers)

Network topology and configuration

![8-1](https://dusunprj.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/DSGW/QSG/DSGK-061-VNC/8-1.png)

The gateway has an Ethernet port (as a WAN port), a dual band WiFi radio (operating in the 2.4G frequency band). 
Pc access gateway  vnc sever by lan or wifi, Mobile phone access vnc sever by wifi 

VNC use rule, this is an example from gateway firmware.
- Name: VNC forwarding
- Protocol: TCP
- Source zone: wan may be "internet", "ap", something that suggests the external source.
- xternal port: 5900 by default or whatever you specified in the app.
- Destination zone: lan something that suggests local network.
- Internal IP address: your device's local IP address, leaving any is less secure. The device's address may change over time! You can look it up in your routers' connected clients info.
- Internal port: same as external port.
Use example :
open vnc
